Changes in 2.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release restructures the source code to provide multiple
modules, each one of which is easier to read and understand.
The organization is analogous to the C source code,
i.e. a Fortran module fgsl_interp exists in analogy to the
C header gsl_interp.h. All fgsl_*.f90 files are placed in the
modules folder. For modules that need explicit C glue code,
an appropriately named file fgsl_*.c exists in the csub folder.

fgsl_complex_math: the legacy complex type has been removed.
    interface added: fgsl_complex_polar

due to build issues with long path names, the __FILE__ macro
is not used any more (issue #36)

Changes in 1.1.0 (by Tom Schoonjans):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This branch introduces support for the recently released gsl 2.1. An overview:

1.  fixed compilation of old fgsl 1.0.0 code against gsl 2.1.
    Note that gsl 2.x has some changed APIs compared to 1.x. These changes carry over to fgsl.
2.  removed support for gsl 1.16 and older: users that need to support these older 
    gsl releases need to install fgsl 1.0.0
3.  bindings written for all newly introduced API since gsl 2.0
4.  some changes to existing fgsl API: removed 'size' arguments wherever sensible as 
    these could be obtained from assumed-shape arrays.
5.  general code cleanup: tried to make things more 'Fortran 2003'
6.  several new tests and examples added


Changes in 1.0.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed interface of fgsl_hypot and added that for fgsl_hypot3
  (bug report from Kyle Gerheiser)


Changes in 1.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added new calls from GSL 1.16
* fixed bug in poly.f90 test (work space too small, triggered

  Burnus for pointing this out
* converted to autotools/autoconf based system. 


Changes in 0.9.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added new calls from GSL 1.15, except gsl_pow_uint

* corrected PUBLICness for some fft calls. Thanks to 
  Dave Allured for reporting this.
* corrected bug in fgsl_odeiv_control_name
* removed unnecessary auxiliary interp functions
* documentation migrated from texi to doxygen-generated HTML.

  Carlo accessors for which there already was something in
  place which does the job.

Changes in 0.9.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
